/*
WHAT IS AN API

Application Programming Interface

Contract provided by one piece of software to another
Structured request and response
We just worked with an API that takes a request and responds with jokes

REST APIS

Representational State Transfer
Architecture style for designing networked applications
Relies on a stateless, client-server protocolo, almost always HTTP
Treats server objects as resources that can be created, destroyed or saved
Can be used by virtually any programming language
All APIS have their own rules and structure

TYPES OF REQUESTS

GET: Retreive data from a specified resource
POST: Submit data to be processed to a specified resource
PUT: Update a specified resource
DELETE: Delete a specified resource

HEAD: Same as get but does not return a body
OPTIONS: Returns the supported HTTP methods
PATCH: Update partial resources

API ENDPOINTS

URLs accessed to perform some operation using an appropriate method, e.g.
GET https://someurl.com/api/users

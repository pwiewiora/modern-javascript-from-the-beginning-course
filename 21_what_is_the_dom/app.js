/*
DOM - DOCUMENT OBJECT MODEL
    - Tree of nodes/elements created by the browser
    - JS can be used to read/write to the DOM and manipulated it
    - Object oriented representation
    Each node has its own set of properties and methods
    that we can use/change/add/remove
    Browser has window object with document object inside then following elements (html, head, body etc)
    Worth using vanilla JS over JQuery to eliminate overhead
